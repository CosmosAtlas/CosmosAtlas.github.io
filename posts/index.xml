      <description>TL;DR: Skip to &amp;ldquo;How to choose your flash card&amp;rdquo; section
 Why this post This is a reflection of my past 2 months of research on NDS flash cards. I wanted a new flash card to enjoy some NDS games, however, the journey wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite smooth as I thought. I&amp;rsquo;ll document the stuffs I learn, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to go through what I did.
Disclaimer: Every card mentioned below unless stated specifically, I own the card at one point.</description>

      <description>Modern text editors will highlight syntax when you are programming. As of everything that is customization, many different colorschemes exists to highlight syntax one way or another. The same idea can also apply to anything with color. In my daily life, that translates to the color of by window manager, and my terminal applications.
Past favorite Most people start by using the default colorscheme that came with your text editor or the terminal.</description>

      <description>Why Asciidoc?Asciidoc is an alternative plain text document format to Markdown. At the every basic level, it provides much more concise control to the document and is more suited for technical writing especially for software documentation.
Markdown by design, is most suited for writing normal text with easy conversions to HTML. The original markdown specs is vague and not concise. Many flavors of markdown is extended upon the original markdown syntax.</description>
